        <h2>Game Developer</h2>
        <p>
          I have experience in game development and consider myself proficient
          in Unity and Unreal Engine. I'm familiar with programming languages
          like <span class="name-highlighter">C, C++, and C#.</span> However, I
          found game development to be quite challenging, leading me to step
          away from it. Currently, I'm fully committed to focusing on web
          development.
